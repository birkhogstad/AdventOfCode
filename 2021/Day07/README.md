## Day 7

For this day I solved Task 1 by finding by sorting the input and found the median.

For Task 2 I had some trouble with the aritmetic, which resulted in several lines. However, the solution I ended up with is moving inwards from both ends of the sorted list, until they cross. This resulted in a runtime I am happy with. With fixed aritmetic I'm sure I would've gotten a faster solution, but a worse algorithm considering runtime. I hope the algorithm came out readable:)

 ### Terminal

 To run the code:
 ```console
 python3 d07.py
 ```

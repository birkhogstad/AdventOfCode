## Day 6


## Thoughts pre-coding

As input was given as a representation of each fish, I thought it would be a great idea to simulate the population for each day...

## Solution

For Task 1 I first simulated the population as a fish for each element in `population` This worked for Task 1, but of course this took too long for Task 2.
Therefore I changed my entire code, which now works for both parts.
My solution was to create an element for the count of fishes # of days till reproduction. This went a lot quicker:)
To check population at a current day, change `DAYS` in line 1 to wanted day

### Terminal

To run:
```console
python3 d05.py

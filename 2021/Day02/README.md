## Day 2
Todays task was also pretty straight forward. I went with Java again, as exams is coming up and I don't have too much time.

### Solution
I went for an non-optimal, but an easily readable solution with input in different ArrayLists. I iterated the list and based `value` after `cmnd`-value. Filled variables `xVal`, `yVal` in Task 1, as well as `aim` in Task 2.

### Terminal

To run:
```console
javac d02.java && java d02<input.txt
```
